Dockerfile Explanations

This file explains the two Dockerfiles in this project.

Dockerfile.multistage (The good one)

This file uses a multi-stage build. This is the best practice for production.

It has two stages:

Stage 1 is the 'builder'. It uses a full Node.js image, copies the package.json, and runs 'npm install' to get all the dependencies (including dev dependencies if we had them). Then it copies the app code.

Stage 2 is the 'runtime'. It starts from a fresh, clean node:alpine image (which is very small). It then copies *only* the necessary files from the 'builder' stage. This means it just copies the node_modules, index.js, and the public folder.

The final image is much smaller because it doesn't have all the build tools, compilers, or extra junk from the npm install. It only has what's needed to run the app.

Dockerfile.single (The simple one)

This one does everything in one go. It's simpler to read.

It starts from the node:alpine image, copies the package.json, runs 'npm install', and then copies the rest of the app code.

The problem is the final image is big because it has all the npm packages and any other tools that 'npm install' might have needed. It's not "clean".

Comparison

The multi-stage image will be much smaller than the single-stage one, which is better for speed and security.
